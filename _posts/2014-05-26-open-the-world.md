Hello!

I'm [@zembutsu](http://twitter.com/zembutsu/). My work is a technical evangelist of a certain company.
I worked as an operation engineer and sysadmin till then for ten several years.
It is operation and monitoring, and my specialty wrestles for automation recently.

I intend to write that I am interested in technology in this blog.
